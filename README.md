#### Entity Framework
Entity Framework is an open source ORM Framework. That means it is an Object-Relational Mapping tool that allows developers alike the ability to work with data using objects. Simply put, it allows developers to work at a higher level of database implementation an management without most (not all) of the data-access. The Entity Framework fits in right before the Database and the beauty is that it is cross platform. It doesn't stop there, there's modelling, Querying, Change Tracking, Saving, Concurrency, Transactions, Caching, Built-in Conventions, Configurations and Migrations...it's pretty powerful stuff which leads to the next topic.

#### Data Seeding
Simple terms Data Seeing is the initial set of data sent to the database when it is installed/instantiated. The initiation is in the Models directory then Data directory.
